# IUS announce

This repository is replacing the LaunchPad [general mailing list][0] and to
a lesser degree the [development mailing list][1].  Due to the difference in
the LaunchPad and GitHub platforms, notifications will change as well.

Issues in this repository will act like an announce style mailing list and will
including end of life and other important announcements.  We would recommend
all IUS users watch this repository.  For users that want more information
about certain packages, it is recommended you follow the package repository
within the [iuscommunity-pkg GitHub organization][2].
